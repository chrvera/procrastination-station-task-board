#Procrastination-Station-Task-Board

# A simple task board that allows the user to imput a title, description and due date for a task into a form. The task populates into a "not yet started" column. Once in progress or done, the task can be clicked and dragged over to the corresponding column. As well, the task cards are white when not due soon, yellow when due soon and red when overdue. Each card also has the ability to be deleted.

# The task board allows a user to not only make a list of task needing to be completed, but also help keep track of when the task is due, using both colors and dates, and determine where the user is at when it comes to completing the task.

# As humans, we all procrastinate. The task board was a simple tool developed to help the every-day person keep an organized list of what needs to be done and visually see their progress and they complete those task.

# This project helped teach me how to properly store data to local storage and problem solved when certain issues arrise when using javascript. Even the smallest of errors can cause an entire project, or the most important parts, to not function at all.
